# Specify your network topology.
# This section indicates how your compute nodes are connected to the fabric's
# switches and ports. The format is as follows:
#
# [apic_switch:<swich_id_from_the_apic>]
# <compute_host>,<compute_host> = <switchport_the_host(s)_are_connected_to>
#
# You can have multiple sections, one for each switch in your fabric that is
# participating in Openstack. e.g.
#
# [apic_switch:17]
# ubuntu,ubuntu1 = 1/10
# ubuntu2,ubuntu3 = 1/11
#
# [apic_switch:18]
# ubuntu5,ubuntu6 = 1/1
# ubuntu7,ubuntu8 = 1/2


# APIC domains are specified by the following sections:
# [apic_physdom:<name>]
#
# [apic_vmdom:<name>]
#
# In the above sections, [apic] configurations can be overridden for more granular infrastructure sharing.
# What is configured in the [apic] sharing will be the default used in case a more specific configuration is missing
# for the domain.
# An example follows:
#
# [apic_vmdom:openstack_domain]
# vlan_ranges=1000:2000
#
# [apic_vmdom:openstack_domain_2]
# vlan_ranges=3000:4000
